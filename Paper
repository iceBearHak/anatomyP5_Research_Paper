Introduction:

Dangers of High School Athletics 
	Athletes are always in danger of suffering many injuries especially traumas that effect them physiologically. As the youth idealize and try to follow in the footsteps of many famous athletes, are the possible risks which can have life changing side effects to many young athletes be worth it. This paper will analyze how dangerous athleticism can be for Desert Mirage athletes and how it can impact their future careers. Students need to be aware of the possible dangers inorder to decide whether they want to do something that can potentially affect them for the rest of their life. “While we’re most likely to think of sprains and broken bones, teens are able to recover from those well; it’s damages that affect growth which should be of more concern” (“The Hidden Dangers”, 2009). While many may say that it’s just part of the sport, its ignorant to think that there will be no serious long term consequences to many of these young athletes.
