Introduction:

Dangers of High School Athletics 
	Athletes are always in danger of suffering many physical injuries that can effect them in their near future. Other potential risk can include psychological traumas or mental disorders. This can sometimes be troubling since a great number of youth idealize and try to follow in the footsteps of many famous athletes. If not guided and informed correctly these young athletes are at the possible risk of developing long term effects that could negatively impact their future lives and careers. This paper will analyze whether the athleticism being taught at Desert Mirage High School has negatively impacted the athletes at this school. Students need to be aware of the possible dangers inorder to decide whether they want to do something that can potentially affect them for the rest of their life. While many may say that itâ€™s just part of the sport, its ignorant to think that there will be no serious long term consequences to their physical and mental health.
