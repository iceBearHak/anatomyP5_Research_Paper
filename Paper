	The results are very conclusive representing Desert Mirageâ€™s athletic system. The students athletes have a basic, but thorough grasp of serious injuries. The students understand and would be aware if they suffered from any serious injury, if they are aware of the dangers of participation in physical activities, and if a past injury has hindered them physically or academically. A majority have stated they are unaware of any changes in behavior, fatigue, or physical participation. The participants who answered that they are unaware of any changes fall under a latter category, where they some do not fall under an absolute yes, or an absolute no. An example would be if the students knew they were being taught how to avoid serious injury; 78% knew very well that they were being informed how to avoid serious injury, while 18% were unaware if anything they were taught had provided any reduction in injuries in general. 
	Surprisingly, 22% of them are unaware if they have ever suffered or sustained any head traumas. However, 20% of the participants have had a head trauma, and are aware of the symptoms of a serious head injury/trauma; thus, some athletes have had experience in identifying a possible brain injury. With the results given, it can be confirmed that more if not all students at Desert Mirage have experience with some type of head trauma or injury, and many know how to identify if they suffer from a serious trauma that may or may not affect them in school or on the field.
